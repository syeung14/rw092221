Overhearing from developers:

I am working on a large enterprise system, with well over ten million lines of code, it sometimes takes hours to get issues resolved.

Smell:
Code is not modular
Large
Not cohesive
Tight coupling
Spaghetti code
Duplicated code
Unnecessary code
Hard to change
Unnecessary complexity
Code that is obsolete but has not been removed
