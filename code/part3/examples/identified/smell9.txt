int _pegs[][] = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}};
//0 is Empty, 1 is O, 2 is X

Smell:
Poor abstraction, and not considering the intent and the domain specific details.

Have you ever seen programmers do the following:

return "running";

return "stopped";

String, int, etc. may not be the right abstraction from the domain point of view.

The code is hard to understand, we can't rely on type verifications when using
statically typed languages.

Another example is where developers may use int for currency.

Solutions?
1. Use enums
2. Create a class
3. Value types where possible or incline class like in Kotlin
