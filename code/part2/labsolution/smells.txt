We may return Optional, but never receive an Optional.

The constructors should not do any real work. They should merely set

Effective Java has a suggestion for constructors:
Instead of using a constructor, they suggest writing static factory
methods and making constructors private or protected.

Avoid throwing exception or creating threads from within constructors.
