Smells:
-primitive obsession for game status and cell status
-string constants
-missing {} for the for and if
-hard coded magic numbers
-constructor doing more work?
-some calculations that could be pull out of the functions
  -method extraction
-high cyclomatic complexity
-unnecessary state that could be moved into local variables
