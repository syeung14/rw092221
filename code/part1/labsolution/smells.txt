We identified the following code and design smells:
-duplication
-poor naming
-may be use an array for buttons
-separate nested class
-long function
-lot of similar variable names
-lack of cohesion in the event handler
-prefer functions with good name instead of comments
-simplify the code, way too complex
-...

How can we proceed from here?
We identified the smells
Pick one significant smell to refactor (consult with a colleague to see if that is good idea)
Write a test and then refactor
