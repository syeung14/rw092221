At the end of each step we want to push the code into the repository.
In this lab solution for you to see more easily the steps, I have created different
directories for each step. In reality, each of these steps will be separate commits to the
main branch.

✓Step0 View the Original code (see the smells.txt file)
✓Step1 WriteUnitTests
✓Step2 ComposeMethod
✓Step3 RemoveDuplication
✓Step4 ReplaceAlgorithm_Looping
✓Step5 FinallyRemoveRedundancy_CleanUpModel
✓Step6 KeepUnitTestSeparate
